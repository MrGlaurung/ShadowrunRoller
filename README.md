# ShadowrunRoller

ShadowrunRoller is the first name for an application that I'm trying to build. First of all it was just going
to be rolling dice Shadowrun style, but then I came up with the idea to be able to generate NPC characters of
different strengths. On top of that I got the idea to also have many characters in memory and generate a combat
outline for those chars with initative and so on and being able to check off each character as they are performing
their actions in a combat round.

These are the thought basic milestones:

* [DONE] Create a program where you can roll a number of D6 Shadowrun style.
* [DONE] Create the possibility to roll edge dice roll.
* [DONE] Create the possibility to add dice to an existing roll and make those dice exploding or not.

When this was done the basic idea of the application was done. Now moving on to more elaborate things.

* [DONE] Create an NPC character with stats, calculated stats, limits and condition.
* [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Create a "vault" to store the character in when they are in memory.
* [FUTURE] Save and load character and save/load a group of characters.
* [FUTURE] Skills, Cyberware, Equipment, Contacts, Spells and Qualities autogenerating and possibility to change around.

With all of this we have a working NPC generator. Then we go to the next step.
